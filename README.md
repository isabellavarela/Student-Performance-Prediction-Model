# Student-Performance-Prediction-Model
This project was completed as part of DTSC 670 – Foundations of Machine Learning (Eastern University, 2024). The goal was to build and evaluate machine learning models to forecast student academic outcomes based on demographic, social, and academic factors.
Project Overview

Built predictive models using Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Lasso Regression.

Evaluated model performance with RMSE and R².

Applied cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.

Found that midterm grades (G1/G2) significantly improved predictive accuracy, enabling early identification of at-risk students.

Analyzed feature importance (e.g., parental education, past failures), offering actionable insights for academic advising and intervention.

## Methods & Tools

Languages/Frameworks: Python, Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Techniques: Regression (Linear, SVR, Lasso), Cross-validation, Feature importance analysis

## Key Results

 Best performing model: SVR with midterm grades included.

 Strong predictors: Midterm grades, prior academic failures, parental education levels.

 Impact: Provides a framework for early detection of at-risk students and supports targeted academic interventions.
